HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor. In this challenge I will refactor code by adding semantic HTML and increasing accessibility

<h2> User Story </h1>
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

<h2> Acceptance Criteria </h2>
<b> GIVEN </b> a webpage meets accessibility standards

<b> THEN </b> I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning


<b> WHEN </b> I view the image elements

<b> THEN </b> I find accessible alt attributes


<b> WHEN </b> I view the heading attributes

<b> THEN </b> they fall in sequential order


<b> WHEN </b> I view the title element
